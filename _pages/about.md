I am Jincheol Ha, a research engineer at CryptoLab Inc., Korea.
I am currently working on addressing privacy issues in real-world applications using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme.

My research interest includes homomorphic encryption schemes such as CKKS and TFHE, the design of symmetric-key primitives for privacy-enhancing technologies (such as homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs), and the cryptanalysis of symmetric ciphers.

I received my B.S. in Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science (double major) from KAIST, and my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Graduate School of Information Security (GSIS) at KAIST, advised by Prof. [Jooyoung Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/cryptlab/home).
During my doctoral studies, I worked on improving the practical use of TFHE by proposing a TFHE-friendly cipher named FRAST, and enhancing methods for the homomorphic evaluation in TFHE.
My thesis is titled "Practical and Efficient Methods to Use the TFHE Scheme".
I also participated in projects designing symmetric-key primitives integrated with another advanced cryptographic protocols such as MPC-in-the-Head and zero-knowledge proofs.
